# cep-aem-search-extension

This is an example of a CEP (Creative Extension Platform) extension for Adobe Photoshop which searches for AEM Assets. It is ugly on purpose.

# Requirements

1. You must have `npm` installed to download the dependencies.
2. You must have the AEM Assets Companion app installed.

# Usage

1. Configure Debug Mode (details in http://www.adobe.com/devnet/creativesuite/articles/a-short-guide-to-HTML5-extensions.html#articlecontentAdobe_text_8) as this is an unsigned extension.
2. Download the files and place them to `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/SearchAEM` on OSX or `%APPDATA%\Adobe\CEP\extensions\SearchAEM` on Windows.
3. Run `npm install`
